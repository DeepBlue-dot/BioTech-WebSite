            <h2>March 15, 2024</h2>
            <p>The first meeting with our advisor and all members of the ISTP
              Group 24 was conducted. The primary objectives of the ISTP project
              were discussed, including the development of practical thinking
              and laboratory skills, the cultivation of critical thinking and
              problem-solving abilities, the implementation of idea generation
              techniques, and the enhancement of collaboration and cooperative
              working skills. Furthermore, it was emphasized that the project
              aims to reflect the combined abilities of students from diverse
              academic backgrounds, such as Biotechnology, Food Science and
              Nutrition, Geology, and Industrial Chemistry. Additionally, the
              importance of effective time management was emphasized to ensure
              the timely completion of the project and to allow for recovery
              time in the event of any adverse circumstances.</p>

            <p>During the meeting, each team member presented their proposed
              ideas orally to the advisor, attempting to convince the advisor to
              select their respective ideas. After a collaborative discussion
              with the advisor, the project
              "Herbal Hair Oil for Effective Antifungal Treatment in Humans from Garlic, Aloe Vera, and Rosemary"
              was collectively selected.</p>

            <p>The team members convened and completed Form-B, which contained
              the selected project title. Subsequently, the group engaged in a
              discussion regarding the preparation of the project proposal,
              including the sharing and allocation of tasks among the team
              members. The content and structure of the project proposal were
              thoroughly deliberated, with the team members clearly defining the
              expected content for each section. Finally, the team established a
              timeline for commencing the project and assigned specific
              responsibilities for drafting the project proposal.</p>

            <p>The team members engaged in a comprehensive discussion regarding
              the detailed methodologies of the project. This included the
              identification of the required apparatuses and the appropriate
              timeline for procuring them, as well as the specific techniques
              and methods to be employed, such as oil extraction, the
              proportions of the oil components, the types of oils to be used,
              and the homogenization techniques. Additionally, the team
              deliberated on the apparatuses to be utilized in the experiment,
              including the separatory funnel and steam distillatory. The group
              also addressed the potential recovery methods in the event that
              the procedures failed to yield the expected results. Furthermore,
              the team discussed the concept of synergization, which refers to
              the combined effect of the various components. Finally, the team
              members discussed the need to have the project funding released
              from the ISTP coordinators as quickly as possible to facilitate
              the timely commencement of the project.</p>

            <p>The team members engaged in detailed discussions regarding the
              laboratories and apparatuses required for the various activities
              planned within the project. We selected primarily three
              laboratories to utilize: the Industrial Chemistry laboratories,
              the Biotechnology laboratories, and the Food Science laboratories.
              Additionally, the team discussed the project funding, and due to
              the lack of a released budget, we were unable to commence any
              activities or provide a progress report. To address this, we
              allocated specific tasks, including appointing liaisons to
              coordinate with the respective laboratory assistants and to
              procure the necessary raw materials immediately after the budget
              is released, in order to facilitate the timely initiation of the
              project.</p>
